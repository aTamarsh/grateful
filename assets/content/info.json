      "content": "Gratitude journaling is a fantastic way to develop a regular practice of appreciating things you are grateful for, and as the old saying goes, practice makes perfect. The act of writing something helps to retrain our brain towards that of thankfulness more than just creating a mental gratitude list.  Specifically, when we use multiple avenues such as thinking, writing and sharing, we have the advantage of increasing the speed at which we train our brain towards appreciation.",
