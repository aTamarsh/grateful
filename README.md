## Installation & App Execution Instructions

1. [Flutter Installation Instructions](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

Follow the installation instructions linked above and begin by selecting the
operating system you are currently on. Follow the linked guide to install the
requisite dependencies for your respective OS.

The above-linked Flutter documentation is written well and easy to follow. You
should have no issues installing the required dependencies (especially on
Windows).

Note that you do not need to "Set up your Android device." Just set up the
Android emulator via Android Studio. The most "complicated" portion might be
enabling VM acceleration on your Windows machine. The documentation thoroughly
covers these steps.

1. [Set up an editor](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor?tab=vscode)

The next step is to set up an editor. The recommended one is VS Code because
it comes with complete Fluter app execution and debug support.
