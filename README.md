# grateful

The Grateful project's purpose is to help people practice gratitude and reflect
positively on their lives by writing about something or someone they are
grateful for, everyday.

The Grateful projectâ€™s resulting product will be a mobile application for
users to practice daily gratitude. Practicing gratitude helps people feel more
positive emotions, relish good experiences, improve their health, deal with
adversity, and build strong relationship. Accordingly, these mobile users
will be practicing gratitude by writing about what they are grateful for while
honing their writing skills.
