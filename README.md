*Grateful* is a mobile application for Android users to practice daily gratitude
by writing every day.

People who engage in daily gratitude tend to feel more positive emotions, relish
good experiences, improve their health, deal with adversity better, and build
stronger relationships. People will cultivate a greater sense of appreciation
for the beauty in their lives by using *Grateful* and ultimately lead a more
fulfilling and enriched life.

## Installation & App Execution Instructions

1. [Flutter Installation Instructions](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

Follow the installation instructions linked above and begin by selecting the
operating system you are currently on. Follow the linked guide to install the
requisite dependencies for your respective OS.

The above-linked Flutter documentation is written well and easy to follow. You
should have no issues installing the required dependencies (especially on
Windows).

Note that you do not need to "Set up your Android device." Just set up the
Android emulator via Android Studio. The most "complicated" portion might be
enabling VM acceleration on your Windows machine. The documentation thoroughly
covers these steps.

2. [Set up an editor](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor?tab=vscode)

The next step is to set up an editor. The recommended one is VS Code because
it comes with complete Fluter app execution and debug support.

3. [Download & Run Source Code](https://github.com/aTamarsh/grateful/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha)

If you already have a copy of the source code on your system, you don't need to
download the the `v0.1.0-alpha` release of Grateful from the above-linked
GitHub repository. However, if you do not have the source code, please download
the latest release of the source code from said repository.

Extract the `grateful` project's source code into your desired directory.

In VSCode, make sure you start an emulator from the bottom right of the screen
by clicking on the available devices area:

Then, select your desired Android emulator from the drop-down menu on VSCode. We
suggest using the `Pixel 6 Pro API 33` emulator because *Grateful* was built
using this device emulator. See the screenshot below:

/>

After you successfully load the Android emulator, navigate to the `main.dart`
file (`grateful/lib/main.dart`) and click the "play" button on the top-right of
your screen (or click on the button's drop down arrow and hit "Start debugging.")

Alternatively, you can simply right click on the `main.dart` file in the file
navigation pane and click "Start debugging.":

Alternatively, if you prefer using the terminal, `cd` into the `grateful` root 
directory and enter the command `flutter run`. This will launch the *Grateful*
app on your select device emulator.
